As of July 2025[update], Tesla operates a network of about 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide. The majority are located in three regions: Asia Pacific (3,000 stations), North America (3,000), and Europe (1,500). Superchargers can currently output as much as 325 kilowatts (kW), with plans to increase output capacity to 500 kW in the future.\nUsage is typically billed by the energy consumed during charging. To discourage loitering, fees may be charged to customers who remain plugged in after charging has been completed.\nTechnology\n[edit]Tesla typically places Superchargers near major highways at locations with amenities for drivers, such as restrooms, restaurants, and shopping.[1] Some sites also have solar canopies and Megapacks[2] installed by Tesla Energy to offset energy use and provide drivers with protection from the elements.[3]\nThe original V1 and V2 Tesla supercharging stations were built with a single charger equipment cabinet consisting of four modules shared between two charge posts. When cars are connected to the two posts, and both request maximum power, the station will assign two or three of the four modules to the car plugged in first, and the rest to the later car, limiting the charging output to each car to 50%-50% or 75%-25%.[4]\nAs an alternative to the Supercharger, in 2015, Tesla briefly implemented a battery swapping station at Harris Ranch in California. The Tesla battery station performed a few swaps and was discontinued shortly afterwards.[5]\n\"Urban\" Supercharger posts were introduced in September 2017. These more compact posts have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW but do not share equipment with other posts, allowing the maximum power to be delivered. These more compact posts are primarily deployed in urban areas such as shopping malls, parking lots, and garages.[6][7]\nV3 stations were introduced in 2019 and could deliver up to 250 kW. Up to four posts can share a 350 kW charger equipment cabinet, but up to three cabinets can share power among themselves via a DC bus. In practice, in most cases, this allows each post to deliver maximum power regardless of nearby charging sessions.[8] The V3 charge posts use a liquid-cooled cable which allows the cable to be thinner and lighter while delivering more power.[9][10]\nTesla introduced mobile Supercharger stations in 2019 with several urban supercharger posts and a Tesla Megapack energy storage system mounted on a semi-trailer truck. These stations provide temporary stations for nearby events, expand capacity during peak travel seasons, or can be deployed when a station needs to be taken offline. The Megapack can charge up to 100 vehicles before being depleted.[11]\nV4 charging posts began to roll out in early 2023 and have longer cables for charging vehicles from other automakers.[12] The charging posts have a credit card reader potentially allowing non-Tesla owners to charge without downloading the Tesla app, however, as of January 2024[update] this feature has not been implemented.[13] The charging posts can support up to 1000 volts and up to 1000 amps (A).[14][15] As of January 2025, they can deliver up to 325 kW.[16] As of Tesla's 2026 model year lineup, only the Cybertruck can charge at 325 kWc.[17] The company plans to increase power delivery to 500 kW in the future.[18]\nOn November 14, 2024, Tesla announced the introduction of the V4 Supercharger cabinet, which will start in 2025. This version can support charging vehicles with 400 and 800 V systems and delivering as much as 1.2 MW.[19]\nAccording to Tesla, in July 2025 the Oto\u010dac Supercharger in Croatia became the first European Supercharger station to be supported by a mobile Megapack.[20]\nConnectors and interoperability\n[edit]North America\n[edit]In February 2023, Tesla began installing the \"Magic Dock\" at select V3 Supercharger locations.[21] This dock houses a NACS (North American Charging System) to CCS1 (Combined Charging System) adapter. When a driver of a NACS-equipped vehicle charges, they simply detach the NACS connector, leaving the adapter locked in place on the charging post. However, when a CCS-equipped vehicle driver reserves a charger via the Tesla mobile app, the Magic Dock unlocks the adapter, making it available for use. The \"magic\" lies in the adapter's captive design\u2014it remains securely locked either in the dock (when a NACS vehicle is charging) or onto the NACS connector (when a CCS vehicle is charging).[22]\nTesla began rolling out V4 Supercharger posts in North ",

It is a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group of America, established in late 2016 by the automaker as part of its efforts to offset emissions in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Volkswagen, as part of its settlement following the \"Dieselgate\" emissions scandal, invested $2 billion in creating Electrify America. In June 2022, Siemens became a minority shareholder of the company. Electrify America supports the CCS and CHAdeMO connector types with plans to add NACS connectors starting in 2025. Electrify America has been the target of significant criticism for the lack of reliability and maintenance of its stations.\nHistory\n[edit]In 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency accused Volkswagen Group of using defeat devices in its diesel-fueled vehicles in order to hide from regulators that the vehicles exceeded emissions standards. The scandal quickly grew, leading eventually to billions of dollars of penalties and agreements to buy back vehicles, among other consequences.[2][3][4]\nAs part of a consent decree reached with United States officials in 2016, Volkswagen agreed to numerous actions, with US$2 billion in total, to promote electric vehicle use over 10 years to atone for the additional air pollution it caused. One aspect of the program was a pledge to establish a public electric vehicle charging network.\nThe Electrify America brand was unveiled in January 2017, along with its first phase of station buildout. Its first station opened in May 2018, in Chicopee, Massachusetts.\nIn June 2022, Electrify America received its first external investor with a $450 million investment from Siemens for a minority shareholder stake, valuing the company at $2.45 billion.[5][6]\nOperations\n[edit]Electrify America stations are frequently located in parking lots and parking garages of big-box stores and shopping malls. The company has location agreements with Walmart, Target and Simon Property Group, among other companies.\nElectrify America stations use the Combined Charging System (CCS) and CHAdeMO connector types with plans to add North American Charging System (NACS) connectors starting in 2025.[7][8][9] Stations are rated to provide a minimum of 50 kilowatts and up to 350 kilowatts, although the actual output is dependent on multiple factors including the vehicle's capabilities.[10][11]\nThe network's chargers support Plug & Charge.[12]\nElectrify America prices its electricity in most states where it operates based on the energy dispensed, charged by kilowatt-hour. In some states, such as Montana and Wyoming, users are charged by the amount of time their vehicle is plugged in. This is usually because the state allows only electric utilities to charge for the amount of electricity a customer uses. Electrify America charges an idle fee when a car is done charging at select locations.[13]\nElectrify America is also building a charger network in Canada called Electrify Canada, and added a commercial section in January 2021 targeting business, utilities and government agencies. Electrify Commercial provides customized end-to-end EV charging solutions to businesses, utility companies, fleet owners, travel centers and convenience stores. In May 2023, they announced an agreement with Rocky Mountain Power to provide fast charging options across the state of Utah with Electrify Commercial providing the charging equipment, installation, and ongoing operations with maintenance. In June 2024, the first charging stations to open as part of Electrify America and Rocky Mountain Power's collaboration were in Millcreek, Utah and Vernal, Utah,[14] followed in July 2024 by a new station in Moab, Utah.[15]\nCriticism\n[edit]Electrify America has been the target of significant criticism for lack of reliability and maintenance of its stations, especially in comparison to the Tesla Supercharger network. There are numerous reports of charge dispensers that remain inoperable or capable of only delivering limited power for weeks or months at a time.[16][17][18][19]\nBecause of the lack of reliability, there is a claim that Electrify America, and all U.S. charging network providers except Tesla, have been more focused on installing new stations than funding operations and maintenance. Electrify America, with almost 4,000 chargers, faces criticism for its day-to-day performance, with reliability issues and consumer dissatisfaction. Despite efforts to improve, drivers report frust",

      "content_summary": "Electric vehicle\nAn electric vehicle (EV) is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity.[1] EVs encompass a wide range of transportation modes, including road and rail vehicles, electric boats and submersibles, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.\nEarly electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century, when the Second Industrial Revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of DC and AC electric motors. Using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness, comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time, but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century. Internal combustion engines (both gasoline and diesel engines) were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electricity-powered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as overhead line-powered mass transit vehicles like electric trains, trams, monorails and trolley buses, as well as various small, low-speed, short-range battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters.\nPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles use electric motors as the primary propulsion method, rather than as a supplement, did not see any mass production until the late 2000s, and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s.\nProgress in batteries, electric motors and power electronics has made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century. As a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and to reduce use of fossil fuels, government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars.[2]\nHistory\n[edit]Electric motive power started in 1827 when Hungarian priest \u00c1nyos Jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor; the next year he used it to power a small model car.[3] In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, built a miniature electric vehicle car, and sometime between 1832 and 1839, Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.[4] American blacksmith and inventor Thomas Davenport built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor, in 1835. In 1838, a Scotsman named Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6 km/h). In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.[5]\nThe first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in America in the early 1900s. In 1902, the Studebaker Automobile Company entered the automotive busine"
